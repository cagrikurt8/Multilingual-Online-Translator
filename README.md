# Multilingual-Online-Translator
This program runs on cmd not any Python IDEs so be careful about that. Firstly, you have to open your cmd screen, then select the directory where this program stored. For example, you have to enter to cmd this line: 'cd C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\my-project' to run this program. 'cd' is a command that let you change your current directory and the path can vary person to person depending on where you stored the code file. After all of that all you need to do is typing the file name, main language, translation language and the word that you want to translate. For example, 'C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\my-project>python translator.py English German hello' will do the trick. 'English' stands for the main language, 'German' stands for the translation language and 'hello' stands for the translation word. Moreover, you can type 'all' instead of 'German' to translate 'hello' to all languages in this list: "Arabic", "German", "English", "Spanish", "French", "Hebrew", "Japanese", "Dutch", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Russian", "Turkish". Finally, the program prints out the word translations and example sentences where the word is used in both languages. Also, it saves the translations in a .txt file named with the word you type.
